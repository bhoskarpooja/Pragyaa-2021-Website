PRAGYAA, A national level technical fiesta of SGGSIE&T, Nanded organized every year to provide a platform for students to show their excellence in techno-social competitions. Each year we have a constructive theme working for the welfare of society & technology. Students come in huge numbers to participate in the multitude of events ranging from the brainstorming junior scientist to the bewildering robotics and get a chance to delve into a variety of exhibits. We aim at focusing on excellence of technology for human welfare and add a new dimension to success of our extravaganza every year so that it will reach the height of its glory.

This is a great experience to be working as Joint-Coordinator as well as a Web Developer at Pragyaa-2021.
